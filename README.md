# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Hybrid-Ensemble-Modeling
Credit card fraud detection using Random Forest, Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest with precision-recall threshold tuning. The project evaluates model performance on imbalanced datasets (Kaggle, PaySim) using F1-score, recall, and precision to optimize fraud classification in real-world scenarios.
